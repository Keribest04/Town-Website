                    TOWN combines a variety of chinese cuisine 
                    to excite and delight our customers. 
                    Our vision for the future is to create 
                    experiential dining that is more than just 
                    a night out. We aim to bring quality and 
                    luxury across all aspects of our brand.
                    The approach of TOWN is to develop our 
                    brand with the understanding of both our 
                    culture and consumer insights. Within our 
                    vision always lives the promise of inspiring 
                    creativity, conversation and quality. 
                    Our audience is a high-end clientele who 
                    values a dining experience. The age range 
                    of our customers are from early 30s-60s.
